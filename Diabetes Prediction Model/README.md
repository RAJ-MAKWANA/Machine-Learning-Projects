_**Diabetes Prediction Model.**_

**Description:-**

1. The diabetes prediction model is generally used to detect if the patient has diabetes or not based on the features in diabetes.csv dataset.
2. The diabetes.csv file consists of 8 features and 1 labeled **"outcome"** which can be used to define if the patient is diabetic or not.
3. The diabetes prediction project consists of multiple packages and concepts such as **Pandas**, **Numpy**, **sklearn** (**SandardScaler**, **accuracyscore**, **svm** and **train_test_split**) which sums up to provide an accuracy of **77%** in our output.
4. The challenge i faced during the project was fetching the feautures randomly/dynamically from the dataset and to convert the fetched features in standardized format for better prediction which at the end got resolved.
